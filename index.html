            "SOME LIKE IT HOT"
            Screenplay by
            Billy Wilder and I.A.L. Diamond
            November 12, 1958
            
            FADE IN:
            CITY AT NIGHT
            A hearse of Late Twenties vintage is proceeding at a dignified
            pace along a half-deserted wintry street.
            Inside the hearse, there are four somber men in black -- and
            a coffin, of course, with a wreath of chrysanthemums on top.
            One of the men is driving, another is in the seat beside
            him. The other two are sitting in the rear of the hearse,
            flanking the coffin. All four seem fully aware of the
            solemnity of the occasion.
            Now they hear a SIREN, faint at first, but rapidly growing
            louder. The driver and the man next to him exchange a nervous
            glance. The other two men move tensely toward the rear door
            of the hearse, raise the black curtain over the glass panel,
            and peek out cautiously.
            Through the glass panel, they see a police car bearing down
            on them, the red light blinking, the SIREN screaming.
            The two men at the rear window gesture to the driver to step
            on it. He does.
            The hearse, obviously a souped-up job, instantly picks up
            speed, weaves crazily through traffic, the police car in hot
            pursuit. The hearse careens around a corner at eighty miles
            an hour, the police car right on its tail.
            By this time the policemen are leaning out of their car with
            drawn guns, firing at the hearse.
            The two men in the rear of the hearse, flattened against the
            sides, pull a couple of sawed-off shotguns out of a hidden
            overhead rack. Police bullets smash the glass panel and
            whistle through the hearse. The driver and the man next to
            him duck, but the hearse continues at the same breakneck
            speed. The two men in back shove their guns through the
            shattered glass, fire at the police car.
            Despite the hail of lead, the police car -- its windshield
            cobwebbed with bullet holes -- gains on the hearse.
            Suddenly the car skids out of control, jumps the curb, comes
            to a screeching stop. Policemen leap out, fire after the
            hearse. 
            In the speeding hearse, the last of the police bullets thud
            into the coffin. Instantly three geysers of liquid spurt
            through the bullet holes. As the firing recedes, the two men
            in the back put away their guns, remove the wreath from the
            coffin, take the lid off. The inside is jam-packed with
            bottles of booze, some of them shattered by the bullets. As
            the men start to lift out the broken bottles --
            SUPERIMPOSE: CHICAGO, 1929
            DISSOLVE TO:
            EXT. INTERSECTION OF STREETS - NIGHT
            Traffic is light. All the shops are dark except one -- a
            dimly lit establishment, from which drift the mournful strains
            of an organ. A circumspect sign reads:
            MOZARELLA'S FUNERAL PARLOR
            24 Hour Service
            In the window, a sample coffin is on display.
            There seem to be some rites going on inside, because a number
            of mourners, singly and in couples, are hurrying from the
            cold, windy street into Mozarella's parlor.
            Meanwhile, the hearse with the damp coffin draws up to the
            delivery entrance at the side of the building. The driver
            honks the horn -- one long and two short -- as the other men
            step down and start to slide the coffin out. The side door
            opens, and a dapper gent emerges. He wears a tight-fitting
            black suit, a black fedora, and gray spats. The spats are
            very important. He always wears spats. His name is SPATS
            COLOMBO. He cases the street, motions the men inside. As
            they carry the coffin past him, he removes his fedora, holds
            it reverently over his heart. Then he follows the men in,
            his head bowed.
            Across the street and around the corner, three police cars
            draw up silently, and about fifteen uniformed policemen and
            plain-clothes men spill out. A Captain gives whispered orders,
            and the men scatter and discreetly take up positions around
            the funeral parlor.
            Out of one of the cars steps MULLIGAN, a tough Federal Agent --
            in plain clothes, of course. With him is a little weasel of
            a man, shivering with cold and fear. They call him TOOTHPICK
            CHARLIE for two reasons -- because his name is Charlie, and
            because he has never been seen without a toothpick in his
            mouth. 
            MULLIGAN
            (indicating funeral
            parlor)
            All right, Charlie -- this the joint?
            TOOTHPICK CHARLIE
            Yes, sir.
            MULLIGAN
            And who runs it?
            TOOTHPICK CHARLIE
            I already told you.
            MULLIGAN
            Refresh my memory.
            TOOTHPICK CHARLIE
            (uneasily)
            Spats Colombo.
            MULLIGAN
            That's very refreshing. Now what's
            the password?
            TOOTHPICK CHARLIE
            I come to Grandma's funeral.
            (he hands him a folded
            piece of black crepe)
            Here's your admission card.
            MULLIGAN
            Thanks, Charlie.
            TOOTHPICK CHARLIE
            If you want a ringside table, tell
            'em you're one of the pall bearers.
            MULLIGAN
            Okay, Charlie.
            The police captain joins Mulligan.
            CAPTAIN
            We're all set. When is the kickoff?
            As Mulligan consults his watch, Charlie, the toothpick working
            nervously in his mouth, tugs Mulligan's sleeve.
            TOOTHPICK CHARLIE
            Look, Chief -- I better blow now,
            because if Spats Colombo sees me,
            it's Goodbye Charlie.
            MULLIGAN
            Goodbye, Charlie. 
            Charlie scoots up the dark street, disappears.
            MULLIGAN
            (to the police captain)
            Give me five minutes -- then hit 'em
            with everything you got.
            CAPTAIN
            You bet!
            They synchronize their watches. Then Mulligan crosses to
            Mozarella's parlor, unfolding the black crepe Charlie gave
            him. It is a mourning band, and he slips it over the left
            sleeve of his overcoat.
            INT. MOZARELLA'S FUNERAL PARLOR - NIGHT
            It looks legitimate enough -- with potted palms, urns and
            funeral statuary. A harmless gray-haired man is playing the
            organ with appropriate feeling. Daintily arranging a funeral
            spray is the proprietor himself, MR. MOZARELLA.
            His heavyweight build, bashed-in nose and cauliflower ears
            don't quite jibe with his mourning coat, striped pants, ascot
            and carnation. Dusting one of the marble angels is another
            funeral director, in the same somber uniform.
            Mulligan enters.
            MOZARELLA
            (with grave sympathy)
            Good evening, sir.
            MULLIGAN
            I come to the old lady's funeral.
            MOZARELLA
            (looking him over)
            I don't believe I've seen you at any
            of our services before.
            MULLIGAN
            That's because I've been on the wagon.
            MOZARELLA
            PLEASE!
            MULLIGAN
            (looking around)
            Where are they holding the wake? I'm
            supposed to be one of the pallbearers.
            MOZARELLA
            (to funeral director)
            Show the gentleman to the chapel --
            pew number three. 
            FUNERAL DIRECTOR
            This way, sir.
            He leads Mulligan past the organ toward the black-paneled
            wall, where there is no evidence of a door.
            The organist, without missing a note in his playing, reaches
            over to the end of the keyboard and pulls out a stop. One of
            the panels slides open, and there is a blast of MUSIC from
            the chapel. It's jazz -- and it's SWEET GEORGIA BROWN.
            Mulligan rears back momentarily, then follows the funeral
            director in. The organist pushes the stop in again, and the
            panel slides shut.
            INT. SPEAKEASY - NIGHT
            Grandma must have been quite a person, because she left a
            lot of condoling friends behind, and they are holding a very
            lively wake. The chapel is jumping. A small band is blaring
            out SWEET GEORGIA BROWN. The musicians are not the slick,
            well-fed instrumentalists you would find in Guy Lombardo's
            band -- they have all been through the wringer, and so have
            their threadbare tuxedos. On the stamp-sized dance floor,
            six girls in abbreviated costumes are doing a frenetic
            Charleston. Crowded around the small tables, mourners in
            black arm-bands are drowning their sorrows in whatever they
            drink out of their coffee cups.
            MULLIGAN
            (looking around)
            Well, if you gotta go -- this is the
            way to do it.
            The funeral director leads Mulligan to a table next to the
            bandstand. As he moves off, a waiter comes up.
            WAITER
            What'll it be, sir?
            MULLIGAN
            Booze.
            WAITER
            Sorry, sir, we only serve coffee.
            MULLIGAN
            Coffee?
            WAITER
            Scotch coffee, Canadian coffee, sour-
            mash coffee...
            MULLIGAN
            Make is Scotch. A demitasse. With a
            little soda on the side. 
            As the waiter starts away, Mulligan stops him.
            MULLIGAN
            Haven't you got another pew -- not
            so close to the band?
            (points to a better
            table)
            How about that one?
            WAITER
            Sorry, sir. That's reserved for
            members of the immediate family.
            He winks, goes off. Mulligan scans the room.
            From a side door comes Spats Colombo, followed by the four
            hearsemen. They walk cockily toward the table 'reserved for
            the immediate family.' A DRUNK, standing with a cup of booze
            in his hand, is in their way. Colombo pushes him aside, and
            the contents of the cup slop over. Colombo freezes in his
            tracks, glances at his feet. The other four men have also
            stopped, and stare in the same direction, horrified.
            Spats Colombo's immaculate spats are no longer immaculate.
            There is a whiskey stain on one of them.
            Colombo throws his henchmen a sharp look. They grab the
            offending drunk, hustle him toward the exit.
            DRUNK
            (waving empty cup)
            Hey -- I want another cup of coffee.
            I want another cup of coffee.
            Colombo proceeds toward the table, seats himself, crosses
            his legs, takes a handkerchief out of his breast pocket, and
            meticulously mops the moist spat. His four companions, their
            mission accomplished, join him at the table.
            Mulligan, who has been studying Colombo, consults his wrist-
            watch. The waiter comes up with his order -- a demitasse
            half full of Scotch, and a split of club soda.
            MULLIGAN
            Better bring the check now -- in
            case the joint gets raided.
            WAITER
            Who's going to raid a funeral?
            MULLIGAN
            Some people got no respect for the
            dead. 
            The waiter moves off. Mulligan sips from the cup, winces,
            takes a cigar out of his pocket and starts to light it. His
            eyes wander to the chorus girls.
            The girls have gone into a tap-dance. The captain of the
            chorus looks toward the bandstand, grins and winks at --
            JOE, the saxophone player. He winks back. JERRY, who is
            thumping the bass-fiddle behind him, leans forward and taps
            Joe on the shoulder.
            JERRY
            Say, Joe -- tonight's the night,
            isn't it?
            JOE
            (eye on tap-dancer)
            I'll say.
            JERRY
            I mean, we get paid tonight, don't
            we?
            JOE
            Yeah. Why?
            He takes the mouthpiece out of his saxophone, wets the reed.
            JERRY
            Because I lost a filling in my back
            tooth. I gotta go to the dentist
            tomorrow.
            JOE
            Dentist? We been out of work for
            four months -- and you want to blow
            your first week's pay on your teeth?
            JERRY
            It's just a little inlay -- it doesn't
            even have to be gold --
            JOE
            How can you be so selfish? We owe
            back rent -- we're in for eighty-
            nine bucks to Moe's Delicatessen --
            we're being sued by three Chinese
            lawyers because our check bounced at
            the laundry -- we've borrowed money
            from every girl in the line --
            JERRY
            You're right, Joe.
            JOE
            Of course I am. 
            JERRY
            First thing tomorrow we're going to
            pay everybody a little something on
            account.
            JOE
            No, we're not.
            JERRY
            We're not?
            JOE
            First thing tomorrow we're going out
            to the dog track and put the whole
            bundle on Greased Lightning.
            JERRY
            You're going to bet my money on a
            dog?
            JOE
            He's a shoo-in. I got the word from
            Max the waiter -- his brother-in-law
            is the electrician who wires the
            rabbit --
            JERRY
            What are you giving me with the
            rabbit?
            JOE
            (pulling form sheet
            out of pocket)
            Look at those odds -- ten to one. If
            he wins, we can pay everybody.
            JERRY
            But suppose he loses?
            JOE
            What are you worried about? This job
            is going to last a long time.
            JERRY
            But suppose it doesn't?
            JOE
            Jerry-boy -- why do you have to paint
            everything so black? Suppose you get
            hit by a truck? Suppose the stock
            market crashes?
            Jerry, slapping the bass, is no longer listening. His eyes
            have strayed to -- 
            Mulligan, sitting at his table, puffing on the cigar. It
            isn't drawing too well. Mulligan reaches under his coat,
            unpins his Department of Justice badge from his vest. Using
            the pin of the shining badge, he pokes a hole in the wet end
            of the cigar.
            Jerry has stopped playing, and is watching Mulligan's
            operation with morbid fascination. Joe, completely unaware,
            continues talking.
            JOE
            Suppose Mary Pickford divorces Douglas
            Fairbanks?
            JERRY
            (nudging him)
            Hey, Joe!
            JOE
            (paying no attention)
            Suppose Lake Michigan overflows?
            JERRY
            Don't look now -- but the whole town
            is under water!
            He nods toward Mulligan. Joe looks off. Then, without a word,
            they both start packing their instruments.
            Mulligan pins the badge back on, checks his wrist-watch.
            MULLIGAN
            (to himself)
            ...four, three, two, one...
            He glances toward --
            the door from the funeral parlor. Right on the dot, a pair
            of police axes smash through the door.
            Instant pandemonium breaks loose in the speakeasy. MUSIC
            stops, women scream, customers, chorus girls and waiter
            scramble toward the side doors. But they too are splintering
            under the assault of the police axes. The crowd falls back,
            milling around frantically.
            Mulligan stands up, cups his hands to his mouth, and roars
            at the top of his voice.
            MULLIGAN
            All right, everybody -- this is a
            raid. I'm a federal agent, and you're
            all under arrest.
            Policemen come streaming through the splintered doors. 
            Carried in on the tide is the Drunk who was just tossed out,
            reeling unsteadily, and waving his empty coffee cup aloft.
            DRUNK
            I want another cup of coffee.
            The policemen start rounding up the customers and employees,
            are herding them toward the exits.
            On the bandstand, Joe and Jerry have packed their instruments,
            and start to fight their way through the melee, toward some
            stairs leading up.
            Mulligan, a couple of policemen in tow, comes up to Spats
            and his henchmen, sitting calmly at their table, with five
            glasses of white liquid in front of them.
            MULLIGAN
            Okay, Spats -- the services are over.
            Lets go.
            SPATS
            Go where?
            MULLIGAN
            A little country club we run for
            retired bootleggers. I'm gonna put
            your name up for membership.
            SPATS
            I never join nothin'.
            MULLIGAN
            You'll like it there. I'll have the
            prison tailor fit you with a pair of
            special spats -- striped!
            SPATS
            (to his companions,
            dead-pan)
            Big joke.
            (to Mulligan)
            Who's the rap this time?
            MULLIGAN
            Embalming people with coffee -- eighty-
            six proof.
            SPATS
            Me? I'm just a customer here.
            MULLIGAN
            Come on, Spats -- we know you own
            this joint. Mozarella is just fronting
            for you. 
            SPATS
            Mozarella? Never heard of him.
            MULLIGAN
            We got different information.
            SPATS
            From who? Toothpick Charlie, maybe?
            MULLIGAN
            Toothpick Charlie? Never heard of
            him.
            He picks up Spats' glass, sniffs it suspiciously.
            SECOND HENCHMAN
            Buttermilk!
            MULLIGAN
            All right -- on your feet.
            SPATS
            (getting up slowly)
            You're wasting the taxpayers' money.
            MULLIGAN
            If you want to, you can call your
            lawyer.
            SPATS
            (pointing to his four
            hoods)
            These are my lawyers -- all Harvard
            men.
            Mulligan and the two policemen lead Spats and his Harvard
            men out.
            EXT. FUNERAL PARLOR - NIGHT
            Policemen, under the supervision of the captain, are herding
            customers into a paddy-wagon. Fighting his way out of the
            wagon is our Drunk, waving his coffee cup in the air.
            DRUNK
            I want another cup of coffee.
            He staggers into the alley, toward the side entrance of the
            speakeasy, CAMERA MOVING with him. Through the smashed-up
            side door, policemen are ushering more customers, waiters,
            musicians and the dancing girls. 
            CAMERA MOVES UP TOWARD a fire escape on the second floor.
            Joe and Jerry, carrying their instruments and overcoats,
            have just climbed through a window onto the fire escape, and
            are inspecting the scene below. The shot-up hearse is parked
            directly beneath them. Stealthily they climb down the ladder,
            drop to the roof of the hearse. Then they scramble over the
            radiator, steal down the alley away from the street. They
            stop in the shadows to put on their coats.
            JERRY
            Well, that solves one problem. We
            don't have to worry about who to pay
            first.
            JOE
            Quiet -- I'm thinking.
            JERRY
            Of course, the landlady is going to
            lock us out. Moe said no more
            knackwurst on credit -- and we can't
            borrow any more from the girls,
            because they're on their way to jail --
            JOE
            Shut up, will you? I wonder how much
            Sam the Bookie will give up for our
            overcoats?
            JERRY
            Sam the Bookie? Nothing doing! You're
            not putting my overcoat on that dog!
            JOE
            I told you -- it's a sure thing.
            JERRY
            But we'll freeze -- it's below zero --
            we'll catch pneumonia.
            JOE
            Look, stupid, he's ten to one.
            Tomorrow, we'll have twenty overcoats!
            DISSOLVE TO:
            EXT. CHICAGO STREET - DAY
            The street is covered with snow. Joe and Jerry, without
            overcoats, the collars of their tuxedos turned up against
            the bitter cold, come down the steps of the elevated, carrying
            their instruments. The only thing that keeps Jerry from
            freezing is that he is boiling over inside. As they proceed
            along the sidewalk, Jerry finally can't hold it any more. 
            JERRY
            Greased Lightning! Why do I listen
            to you? I ought to have my head
            examined!
            JOE
            I thought you weren't talking to me.
            JERRY
            Look at the bull fiddle -- it's
            dressed warmer than I am.
            They come up to a building in front of which are gathered
            several small groups of shivering musicians, also equipped
            with instruments. Joe and Jerry exchange frozen waves with
            their colleagues, start through the entrance.
            DISSOLVE TO:
            INT. CORRIDOR OF MUSIC BUILDING - DAY
            Joe moves down the corridor, Jerry tagging along grimly beside
            him. Other job-seeking musicians mill around, and a melange
            of musical sounds and singing voices issues from the various
            offices, studios and rehearsal halls.
            Joe and Jerry come up to a door marked: KEYNOTE MUSICAL AGENCY --
            BANDS, SOLOISTS, SINGERS. Joe opens the door, revealing a
            crummy office, with a secretary behind a desk.
            JOE
            Anything today?
            FIRST SECRETARY
            Nothing.
            JOE
            Thank you.
            Joe shuts the door, and they shuffle along to the next agency,
            which is marked: JULES STEIN -- MUSIC CORPORATION OF AMERICA.
            Joe opens the door. This is like the other office -- except
            a little crummier. There is a secretary behind the desk.
            JOE
            Anything today?
            SECOND SECRETARY
            Nothing.
            JOE
            Thank you. 
            He opens the door to the next agency. On the door it says:
            SIG POLIAKOFF -- BANDS FOR ALL OCCASIONS. There is the usual
            secretary behind the usual desk, and her name is NELLIE. She
            is a brunette, somewhat past her prime, but still attractive.
            JOE
            Anything today?
            NELLIE
            (looking up)
            Oh, it's you! You got a lot of nerve --
            JOE
            Thank you.
            He shuts the door quickly, starts to move on.
            NELLIE'S VOICE
            (from inside)
            Joe -- come back here!
            Joe stops in his tracks. With a resigned shrug to Jerry, he
            opens the door again, and the two of them start in.
            INT. POLIAKOFF'S OUTER OFFICE - DAY
            Beside Nellie, there is another secretary pecking away at a
            typewriter. Nellie's face is grim as Joe and Jerry come up.
            JOE
            Now look, Nellie -- if it's about
            last Saturday night -- I can explain
            everything.
            NELLIE
            (to Jerry; pointing
            at Joe)
            What a heel! I spend four dollars to
            get my hair marcelled, I buy me a
            new negligee, I bake him a great big
            pizza pie...
            (to Joe)
            -- and where were you?
            JERRY
            Yeah -- where were you?
            JOE
            With you.
            JERRY
            With me? 
            JOE
            Don't you remember?
            (to Nellie)
            He has this bad tooth -- it got
            impacted -- the whole jaw swole up --
            JERRY
            It did?
            (Joe throws him a
            look)
            Boy, did it ever!
            JOE
            So I had to rush him to the hospital
            and give him a transfusion...
            (to Jerry)
            Right?
            JERRY
            Right. We have the same blood type...
            JOE
            -- Type O.
            NELLIE
            Oh?
            JOE
            Nellie baby, I'll make it up to you.
            NELLIE
            You're making it up pretty good so
            far.
            JOE
            The minute we get a job, I'm going
            to take you out to the swellest
            restaurant --
            JERRY
            How about it, Nellie? Has Poliakoff
            got anything for us? We're desperate.
            NELLIE
            (slyly)
            Well, it just so happens he is looking
            for a bass and a sax --
            (to the other secretary)
            Right?
            (she winks at her)
            OTHER SECRETARY
            (going along)
            Right. 
            JERRY
            (all excited)
            Did you hear that, Joe?
            JOE
            What's the job?
            NELLIE
            It's three weeks in Florida --
            JERRY
            Florida?
            NELLIE
            The Seminole-Ritz, in Miami.
            Transportation and all expenses
            paid...
            JOE
            Isn't she a bit of terrific?
            (busses Nellie on the
            cheek; to Jerry)
            Come on -- let's talk to Poliakoff.
            They start toward the door of the inner office.
            NELLIE
            You better wait a minute, boys --
            he's got some people in there with
            him.
            That stops them.
            INT. POLIAKOFF'S INNER OFFICE - DAY
            The room is small and cluttered, and the walls are covered
            with photographs of Poliakoff's clients -- bands, vocalists,
            trios, radio personalities.
            Sitting behind the desk, speaking urgently into the phone,
            is SIG POLIAKOFF, a gruff, likable man in his fifties. Pacing
            up and down on the other side of the desk is SWEET SUE,
            flashily-dressed broad, who has seen thirty summers and a
            few hard winters. As she paces, she nervously flips a large
            white pill from one hand to the other. Slouched in a chair
            is BIENSTOCK, a somewhat prissy man of forty wearing thick
            glasses. He has a card file on his lap, is thumbing through
            it. 
            POLIAKOFF
            (into phone)
            Look, Gladys, it's three weeks in
            Florida -- Sweet Sue and Her Society
            Syncopators -- they need a couple of
            girls on sax and bass -- what do you
            mean, who is this? Sig Poliakoff. I
            got a job for you -- Gladys, are you
            there?
            (hangs up)
            Meshugeh! Played for a hundred and
            twelve hours at a marathon dance,
            and now she's in bed with a nervous
            collapse.
            SUE
            Tell her to move over.
            She has poured herself a glass of water from a pitcher on
            the desk, and now she plops the pill into her mouth, washes
            it down.
            BIENSTOCK
            (looking up from file)
            What about Cora Jackson?
            POLIAKOFF
            The last I heard, she was playing
            with the Salvation Army, yet.
            (consulting list on
            desk; into phone)
            Drexel 9044.
            Sue has wandered over to one of the framed photos on the
            wall. It shows Sue posed in front of her band -- sixteen
            girls, all blonde, all in identical gowns. On the drum it
            says SWEET SUE AND HER SOCIETY SYNCOPATORS.
            SUE
            Those idiot broads! Here we are all
            packed to go to Miami, and what
            happens? The saxophone runs off with
            a Bible salesman, and the bass fiddle
            gets herself pregnant.
            (turning to Bienstock)
            I ought to fire you, Bienstock.
            BIENSTOCK
            Me? I'm the manager of the band --
            not the night watchman. 
            POLIAKOFF
            (into phone)
            Hello? Let me talk to Bessie Malone --
            what's she doing in Philadelphia? --
            on the level?
            (hangs up)
            Bessie let her hair grow and is
            playing with Stokowski.
            SUE
            Black Bottom Bessie?
            POLIAKOFF
            Schpielt zich mit der Philharmonic.
            BIENSTOCK
            How about Rosemary Schultz?
            POLIAKOFF
            Did you hear? She slashed her wrists
            when Valentino died!
            SUE
            We might as well all slash our wrists
            if we don't round up two dames by
            this evening.
            She picks up her handbag. Bienstock rises, takes his glasses
            off, puts them in his pocket.
            BIENSTOCK
            Look, Sig, you know the kind of girls
            we need. We don't care where you
            find them -- just get them on that
            train by eight o'clock.
            POLIAKOFF
            Be nonchalant. Trust Poliakoff. The
            moment anything turns up, I'll give
            you a little tingle.
            SUE
            Bye, Sig.
            (feels her tummy)
            I wonder if I have room for another
            ulcer?
            Bienstock opens the door, and follows Sue into the outer
            office. Joe and Jerry, who have been biding their time
            outside, slip in and shut the door after them.
            JOE
            Hey, Sig -- can we talk to you? 
            POLIAKOFF
            (into phone)
            Nellie, get me long distance.
            (to the boys)
            What is it?
            JERRY
            It's about the Florida job.
            POLIAKOFF
            The Florida job?
            JOE
            Nellie told us about it.
            JERRY
            We're not too late, are we?
            POLIAKOFF
            What are you -- a couple of comedians?
            Get out of here!
            (into phone)
            Long distance? Get me the William
            Morris Agency in New York.
            JOE
            You need a bass and a sax, don't
            you?
            POLIAKOFF
            The instruments are right, but you
            are not.
            (into phone)
            I want to speak to Mr. Morris.
            JERRY
            What's wrong with us?
            POLIAKOFF
            You're the wrong shape. Goodbye.
            JOE
            The wrong shape? You looking for
            hunchbacks or something?
            POLIAKOFF
            It's not the backs that worry me.
            JOE
            What kind of band is this, anyway?
            POLIAKOFF
            You got to be under twenty-five --
            JERRY
            We could pass for that. 
            POLIAKOFF
            you got to be blonde --
            JERRY
            We could dye our hair.
            POLIAKOFF
            -- and you got to be girls.
            JERRY
            We could --
            JOE
            No, we couldn't!
            POLIAKOFF
            (into phone)
            William Morris!
            JERRY
            You mean it's a girls' band?
            JOE
            Yeah, that's what he means. Good old
            Nellie!
            (starting toward door)
            I ought to wring her neck!
            POLIAKOFF
            (into phone)
            Yes, I'm holding on.
            JERRY
            Wait a minute, Joe. Lets talk this
            over.
            (to Poliakoff)
            Why couldn't we do it? Last year,
            when we played in that gypsy tea
            room, we wore gold earrings. And you
            remember when you booked us with
            that Hawaiian band?
            (pantomiming)
            Grass skirts!
            POLIAKOFF
            (to Joe)
            What's with him -- he drinks?
            JOE
            No. And he ain't been eating so good,
            either. He's got an empty stomach
            and it's gone to his head. 
            JERRY
            But, Joe -- three weeks in Florida!
            We could borrow some clothes from
            the girls in the chorus --
            JOE
            You've flipped your wig!
            JERRY
            Now you're talking! We pick up a
            couple of second-hand wigs -- a little
            padding here and there -- call
            ourselves Josephine and Geraldine --
            JOE
            Josephine and Geraldine!
            POLIAKOFF
            (into phone)
            Hello, Mr. Morris? This is Poliakoff,
            in Chicago. Say, you wouldn't have a
            couple of girl musicians available?
            A sax player and a base? 
            JERRY
            (at the door)
            Look, if William Morris doesn't come
            through --
            JOE
            Come on, Geraldine!
            He pulls him into the outer office.
            INT. POLIAKOFF'S OUTER OFFICE - DAY
            Joe leads Jerry out.
            JERRY
            It's a hundred miles, Joe -- it's
            snowing -- how are we going to get
            there?
            JOE
            I'll think of something. Don't crowd
            me.
            NELLIE
            (brightly)
            How did it go, girls?
            JERRY
            We ought to wring your neck.
            JOE
            Please, Jerry -- that's no way to
            talk.
            (turning on the charm)
            Nellie baby -- what are you doing
            tonight?
            NELLIE
            (suspiciously)
            Why?
            JOE
            Because I got some plans --
            NELLIE
            I'm not doing anything. I just thought
            I'd go home and have some cold pizza --
            JOE
            And you'll be in all evening?
            NELLIE
            (melted by now)
            Yes, Joe. 
            JOE
            (brightly)
            Good! Then you won't be needing your
            car.
            NELLIE
            My car? Why, you --
            Joe silences her protest with a kiss. Jerry shakes his head
            with mock admiration.
            JERRY
            Isn't he a bit of terrific?
